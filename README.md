## About The Project

This project started with me wanted to write a sudoku-solving algorithm and a simple interface to visualize it ( [version 1](https://github.com/Radian6405/Sudoku_Solver) ). Eventually, I got into React and decided it would be fun to remake it with actual playing functionality. It still has the auto solving feature tho.
